1. Problem Statement:
A program needs to collect three psychometric data values from the PHQ9,
 GAD7, and MMPI. These values will form the baseline for the client;
 subsequent visits need to compare visit scores to the baseline.

 Depending on what the difference, what actions should
 be taken (choice a, choice b, choice c)

Nouns: initial PHQ9, GAD7, MMPI; followup PHQ9, GAD7, MMPI

Verbs: difference, convert

2. Defining Diagram

INPUT: clientName; basePHQ9, baseGAD7, baseMMPI; followupVisitPHQ9, followupVisitGAD7, followupVisitMMPI

PROCESSING:
differencePHQ9 = basePHQ9 - followupVisitPHQ9
differenceGAD7 = baseGAD7 - followupVisitGAD7 - base GAD7
differenceMMPI = baseMMPI - followupVisitMMPI - base MMPI

OUTPUT:
client name
differencePHQ9
differenceGAD7
differenceMMPI

Step 3) Solution Algorithm


SOLUTION ALGORITHM:
mentalHealthMetrics
    prompt for clientName with "What is the first and last name of client?"
    prompt for basePHQ9 value with "Enter the score from the initial PHQ9"
    convert basePHQ9 to number
    prompt for baseGAD7 value with "Enter the initial score from the GAD7"
    convert baseGAD7 to number
    prompt for baseMMPI value with "Enter the initial score from the MMPI"
    convert baseMMPI to number

    prompt for followupVisitPHQ9 with "Enter the score from the PHQ9 at follow up."
    convert followupPHQ9 to number
    prompt for followupVisitGAD7 with "Enter the score from the GAD7 at follow up."
    convert followupVisitGAD7 to number
    prompt for followupVisitMMPI with "Enter the score from the MMPIat follow up."
    convert followupVisitMMPI to number


   difference = (basePHQ9 - followupVisitPHQ9)
   difference = (baseGAD7 - followupVisitGAD7)
   difference = (baseMMPI - followupVisitMMPI)

   IF (NaN(difference))
    THEN output = "You have entered invalid input; please make sure you are only
                   entering numeric values"
   IF (PHQ9, GAD7, MMPI) difference > 0 || (PHQ9, GAD7, MMPI) difference < 6
    THEN output="After the last appointment " + clientName + "'s mental health " +
                       "experienced a slight positive trajectory
   ELSEIF (PHQ9, GAD7, MMPI) difference > 7 || (PHQ9, GAD7, MMPI) < 13
    THEN output = ""After the last appointment" + clientName + " 's mental health"
                  "experienced a significant positive trajectory; inquire about life changes."
                  + "\n\nContinue working with " + clientName + "if possible."

    ELSEIF (PHQ9, GAD7, MMPI) > 14
    THEN output = "Since the last appointment " + clientName + "experienced an extreme positive shift" +
                  "\nIf this is a sudden shift, and not the result of a major life change" +
                  ", consider screening for a manic episode"
   ENDIF
  ENDIF

END
