        <h3>Step 1) Problem Statement</h3>
<pre class="pseudocode">
1. Problem Statement:
  A program needs to collect three psychometric data values from the PHQ9,
 GAD7, and MMPI. These values will form the baseline for the client;
 subsequent visits need to compare visit scores to the baseline.

 Depending on what the difference, what actions should
 be taken (choice a, choice b, choice c)

Nouns: PHQ9, GAD7, MMPI

Verbs: difference, baseline, visitValue, convert

</pre>

        <h3>Step 2) Defining Diagram</h3>
<pre class="pseudocode">
INPUT:
  clientName; basePHQ9, baseGAD7, baseMMPI; followupVisitPHQ9, followupVisitGAD7,
  followupVisitMMPI

PROCESSING:
  differencePHQ9 = basePHQ9 - followupVisitPHQ9
  differenceGAD7 = baseGAD7 - followupVisitGAD7
  differenceMMPI = baseMMPI - followupVisitMMPI

OUTPUT:
  client name
  differencePHQ9
  differenceGAD7
  differenceMMPI

</pre>

        <h3>Step 3) Solution Algorithm</h3>
<pre class="pseudocode">
SOLUTION ALGORITHM:
  mentalHealthMetrics
    prompt for clientName with "What is the first and last name of client?"
    prompt for basePHQ9 value with "Enter the score from the PHQ9"
    convert basePHQ9 to number
    prompt for baseGAD7 value with "Enter the score from the GAD7"
    convert baseGAD7 to number
    prompt for baseMMPI value with "Enter the score from the GAD7"
    convert baseMMPI to number

    prompt for followupVisitPHQ9 with "Enter the score from the PHQ9"
    convert followupVisitPHQ9 to number
    prompt for followupVisitGAD7 with "Enter the score from the GAD7"
    convert followupVisitGAD7 to number
    prompt for followupVisitMMPI with "Enter the score from the MMPI"
    convert followupVisitMMPI to number


   difference = (basePHQ9 - followupPHQ9)
   difference = (baseGAD7 - followupVisitGAD7)
   difference = (baseMMPI - followupVisitMMPI)

 IF (NaN(difference))
    THEN output = "You have entered invalid input; please make sure you are only
                   entering numeric values"

    THEN output="After the last appointment " + clientName + "'s mental health " +
                       "experienced a slight positive trajectory"

                  "\nIf this is a sudden shift, and not the result of a major life change" +
                  ", consider screening for a manic episode"
   ENDIF
  ENDIF
